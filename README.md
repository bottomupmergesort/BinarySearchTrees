# BinarySearchTrees
Various Self Balancing Binary Search Trees

This is the implementation for BST based symbol tables from Robert Sedgewicks "Algorithms in C++" third edition.
It has algorithms for:

1)Tree insertion:
    - Splay Tree insertion     (self balancing tree)
    - Randomized BST insertion (self balancing tree)
    - Red/Black tree insertion (self balancing tree)
    - Plain BST insertion
    - BST Root insertion

2) Joining trees
3) kth value selection
4) delete node by key
4) balance a tree recursively
5) print tree in sorted order (in-order traversal, recursive)
6) print tree in level order (Breadth First Traversal, iterative FIFO queue)

all algorithms work as advertsed.
